# SAT-GRE-Style-Sentence-Completion

Environment: 
-------------

To run the files JDK6+ should be installed. No arguments  should be given. 

Dataset:
---------

1)Training and testing data taken from the website http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/scc/ is  organised into folders "Holmes_Training_Data" and  "testing_data" . These folders have been assumed to be present in the same folder 
as the source code files. If not, path where the  dataset is taken from  has to be changed in the code. The files "Holmes.machine_format.questions.txt" and  "Holmes.machine_format.answers.txt" are used for testing and are considered as the gold standard.

2) Microsoft Web Service is used to obtain the N-gram probabilities in Microsoft Web Corpus. For using Microsoft Web Services, authentication token is required which can be obtained from the website http://web-ngram.research.microsoft.com/  

3) For using WordNet, API jar taken from edu.mit.jwi needs to be used and for using Latent Semantic Analysis code, API jar downloaded from http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/ needs to be used
